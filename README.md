<h1 align="center">VibeSkua Linux</h1>

> **Note:** This project is **Vibe Coded** — built through AI-assisted development and pure momentum.

**VibeSkua Linux** is a **native Linux port** of [VibeSkua](https://github.com/Durstronaut/Linux-SKUA) (itself a feature-rich fork of [auqw/skua](https://github.com/auqw/skua)) — the same advanced AQW automation, army control, and scripting, running **natively on Linux with no Wine and no VM**.

It swaps the two Windows-only pieces of Skua for native equivalents:

- **Flash ActiveX → [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs).** The proprietary Flash Player ActiveX control is replaced by Ruffle (`ruffle_core`), embedded directly in-process. AQW itself is Flash/AVM2; Ruffle runs it natively on Linux.
- **WPF → [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net).** The WPF UI is rebuilt in Avalonia. Every one of Skua's 89 ViewModels already lives in `Skua.Core` on `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` and is UI-framework-agnostic, so the port is a pure view rewrite over the *same* engine.

The engine, scripts, and behavior are unchanged — this is the same bot, hosted on a Linux-native stack.

## Status

| Layer | What | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Core engine** (~40k LOC) | `Skua.Core`, `.Interfaces`, `.Models`, `.Utils`, `.Generators` | ✅ Builds native `net10.0` on Linux, 0 errors. All 89 ViewModels + the full `IScriptInterface` bot graph resolve and run. |
| **2. UI** (~9.5k LOC) | `Skua.WPF` → `Skua.Avalonia` | ✅ Whole UI ported — 65+ views (main bot app, all dialogs, pop-out panels, and the Skua.Manager multi-account launcher), 35 headless tests. |
| **3. Flash runtime** | Flash ActiveX → embedded `ruffle_core` | ✅ Real `ruffle_core` embedded in `libskua_flash.so`; ExternalInterface round-trips both directions against a real AVM2 SWF (verified in CI). |
| **Packaging** | Velopack AppImage | ✅ `vpk`-built `.AppImage`, self-contained (no .NET install needed). |

**The port works end to end**, verified on real hardware: the game renders, login works, and real CoreBots scripts compile, run, and drive the character in live AQW. Hotkeys, army control across clients, pop-out panels, tray notifications, plugins, auto-updates, and theme editing all work — see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [`LINUX.md`](LINUX.md) for the full engineering status.

## Install / Run (AppImage)

Download the latest `VibeSkuaLinux.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/Redu667/VibeSkua-Linux/releases), then:

```bash
chmod +x VibeSkuaLinux.AppImage
./VibeSkuaLinux.AppImage
```

The AppImage is self-contained — it bundles the .NET runtime, the Avalonia UI, and `libskua_flash.so` (with Ruffle embedded), so no separate .NET or Flash install is required. On distros without FUSE, run `./VibeSkuaLinux.AppImage --appimage-extract` and launch the extracted `AppRun`.

Velopack provides in-app auto-update from GitHub Releases.

## Building from source

**Requirements:** .NET 10 SDK, a Rust toolchain (nightly, for the Ruffle runtime), and `squashfs-tools` (for AppImage packaging).

```bash
# Run the headless engine + Flash-bridge smoke test (no display needed):
dotnet run --project Skua.App.Console -c Release

# Build & run the Avalonia app:
dotnet run --project Skua.Avalonia -c Release

# Headless UI tests:
dotnet test Skua.Avalonia.Tests -c Release
```

The Rust Flash bridge (`libskua_flash.so`) builds automatically as part of the C# build. It has two backends:

- **default** — an offline mock of AQW's `world` object, so the whole pipe runs and tests with no network or game (any stable Rust).
- **`ruffle`** — the real embedded `ruffle_core` engine. Build the app with the real runtime bundled:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly       # ruffle_core needs a nightly toolchain
dotnet build Skua.Avalonia -c Release -p:SkuaRuffle=true
```

### Packaging an AppImage

```bash
dotnet tool install -g vpk
./packaging/build-appimage.sh 0.1.0     # publishes + packs -> packaging/Releases/VibeSkuaLinux.AppImage
```

`Skua.Linux.sln` deliberately contains only the projects that build on Linux. The WPF/WinForms projects (`Skua.WPF`, `Skua.App.WPF*`, `Skua.Manager`) are excluded — their XAML markup compiler is Windows-only. The original Windows build is unaffected and lives alongside this port.

## What carries over from VibeSkua

All of VibeSkua's features are engine/ViewModel-level and therefore portable as-is — Discord integration, headless mode, script scheduling with silent/unattended profiles, the multi-account army control + grid view, function-based skills, loadouts manager, smart quest sync, custom script loading, hotkeys, and the performance/stability work. The Linux port hosts the identical engine; only the rendering (Ruffle) and windowing (Avalonia) layers are new. See the [VibeSkua feature list](https://github.com/Durstronaut/Linux-SKUA) for the full breakdown.
